In this post, I'll share best practices I've learned over the years.\n\n## The Importance of API Testing\n\nAPIs are the connective tissue of modern applications. Testing them ensures:\n\n- Data integrity between services\n- Proper error handling\n- Security vulnerabilities are caught early\n- Performance meets expectations\n\n## Essential API Tests\n\n### 1. Response Status Codes\n\nAlways verify the correct status code is returned:\n\n```javascript\npm.test(\"Successful request returns 200\", () => {\n  pm.response.to.have.status(200);\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Response Body Validation\n\nCheck that the response contains expected data:\n\n```javascript\npm.test(\"User data is correct\", () => {\n  const jsonData = pm.response.json();\n  pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql(\"John Doe\");\n  pm.expect(jsonData.email).to.include(\"@example.com\");\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Response Time\n\nEnsure APIs perform within acceptable limits:\n\n```javascript\npm.test(\"Response time is under 500ms\", () => {\n  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);\n});\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n| Test Type | Purpose | Frequency |\n|-----------|---------|-----------|\n| Smoke | Quick sanity check | Every deployment |\n| Functional | Feature validation | Every PR |\n| Regression | Full coverage | Daily |\n| Performance | Load testing | Weekly |\n\n## Postman Collection Structure\n\nOrganize your collections logically:\n\n```\n📁 API Collection\n├── 📁 Authentication\n│   ├── Login\n│   ├── Register\n│   └── Refresh Token\n├── 📁 Users\n│   ├── Get All Users\n│   ├── Get User by ID\n│   ├── Create User\n│   └── Update User\n└── 📁 Products\n    ├── List Products\n    └── Get Product Details\n```\n\n## Automation with Newman\n\nRun your Postman collections in CI/CD:\n\n```bash\nnewman run collection.json --environment dev.json --reporters cli,junit\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Test edge cases** - Don't just test happy paths\n2. **Validate security** - Check authentication and authorization\n3. **Monitor performance** - Set up alerts for slow endpoints\n4. **Document everything** - Make tests self-documenting\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAPI testing is not optional—it's essential. Invest time in building comprehensive API tests, and your applications will be more reliable and maintainable.\n\n---\n\n*Want to learn more about setting up API tests?

In this guide, I'll walk you through building a robust test automation framework from scratch.\n\n## Why Test Automation?\n\nManual testing is time-consuming and prone to human error. Automation helps you:\n\n- **Run tests repeatedly** without additional effort\n- **Catch regressions** early in the development cycle\n- **Increase test coverage** across browsers and platforms\n- **Reduce CI/CD pipeline** execution time\n\n## Choosing the Right Tool\n\nFor modern web applications, I recommend **Playwright** because:\n\n| Feature | Benefit |\n|---------|---------|\n| Auto-wait | No flaky tests due to timing |\n| Cross-browser | Test on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit |\n| Modern APIs | TypeScript support out of the box |\n| Fast execution | Parallel test execution |\n\n## Setting Up Your Framework\n\n```bash\nnpm init playwright@latest\n```\n\nThis sets up everything you need, including:\n- Playwright Test runner\n- TypeScript configuration\n- Example tests\n\n## Automation Progress\n\n| Year | Skill Level |\n|------|-------------|\n| 2020 - Started | 30% |\n| 2021 - Learning | 55% |\n| 2022 - Intermediate | 75% |\n| 2023 - Advanced | 90% |\n| 2024 - Expert | 95% |\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Start simple** - Don't over-engineer your framework initially\n2. **Use Page Object Model** - Keeps tests maintainable\n3. **Implement reporting** - Know what passed/failed instantly\n4. **Integrate with CI/CD** - Automate your testing pipeline\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTest automation is an investment that pays off over time. Start small, learn continuously, and you'll see the benefits in your development workflow.\n\n---\n\n*Have questions?
