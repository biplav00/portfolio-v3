API testing is the backbone of modern software quality. In this post, I'll share best practices I've learned over the years.

## The Importance of API Testing

APIs are the connective tissue of modern applications. Testing them ensures:

- Data integrity between services
- Proper error handling
- Security vulnerabilities are caught early
- Performance meets expectations

## Essential API Tests

### 1. Response Status Codes

Always verify the correct status code is returned:

```javascript
pm.test("Successful request returns 200", () => {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

### 2. Response Body Validation

Check that the response contains expected data:

```javascript
pm.test("User data is correct", () => {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql("John Doe");
  pm.expect(jsonData.email).to.include("@example.com");
});
```

### 3. Response Time

Ensure APIs perform within acceptable limits:

```javascript
pm.test("Response time is under 500ms", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});
```

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Smoke | Quick sanity check | Every deployment |
| Functional | Feature validation | Every PR |
| Regression | Full coverage | Daily |
| Performance | Load testing | Weekly |

## Postman Collection Structure

Organize your collections logically:

```
📁 API Collection
├── 📁 Authentication
│   ├── Login
│   ├── Register
│   └── Refresh Token
├── 📁 Users
│   ├── Get All Users
│   ├── Get User by ID
│   ├── Create User
│   └── Update User
└── 📁 Products
    ├── List Products
    └── Get Product Details
```

## Automation with Newman

Run your Postman collections in CI/CD:

```bash
newman run collection.json --environment dev.json --reporters cli,junit
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Test edge cases** - Don't just test happy paths
2. **Validate security** - Check authentication and authorization
3. **Monitor performance** - Set up alerts for slow endpoints
4. **Document everything** - Make tests self-documenting

## Conclusion

API testing is not optional—it's essential. Invest time in building comprehensive API tests, and your applications will be more reliable and maintainable.
